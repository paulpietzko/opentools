# OpenTools

**OpenTools** is an open-source collection of simple, useful web-based tools — all in one place. From image resizing to diff checking, the goal is to provide fast, lightweight, and privacy-friendly utilities for everyday developers, designers, and curious users.

- 🧰 Dozens of single-purpose tools
- ⚡️ Fast, responsive UI built with Next.js
- 🔓 100% open source and free to use
- 🔒 No data stored or sent to external servers

Whether you're tweaking an image, comparing files, or converting formats, OpenTools aims to be your go-to utility belt — with no clutter, no bloat, and no nonsense.
